#### Introduction
This is the first assignment of the "Assembly Language and Microcomputer" course at NSYSU.

Main targets:
- Write an ARM assembly code to implement a reverse program which can print out the input string in reverse order to the screen.
- In addition, the English letters in the string have to be converted to lowercase.

#### Run
For example, when you execute reverse program as follows:  
```
arm-none-eabi-run reverse “It is Tom's apple.”
```

Then the screen should show the following results:  
```
reversed result: .elppa s'mot si ti
```
